# VBA Database Management
How to make a simple but effective small database on Excel.

This repository shows a simple VBA script that had been made during my 3rd year bachelor degree's final project, where the aim was to study beers sold in pubs and discover what factors could have a significant impact on their prices. It allowed me to fill informations in a panel, check for double entries and merge two different databases.

I draw the reader's attention to the fact that although it is, in my opinion, an efficient script, Excel is not optimal at all for any big data analysis.
